I prefer the steak house style ‘plate’ of hashbrowns, where it is one solid layer of potatoes with a brown crust on both sides.

Serves 2

Ingredients:
- 2 russet potatoes
- Salt and pepper
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 2 cloves of garlic (minced)

Directions:
1. Prepare and parboil potatoes
    1. Scrub potatoes and place in pot (Do not peel or remove brown spots)
    2. Fill pot with cold water 1 inch above potatoes and add 1 tsp of salt
    3. Bring pot to a boil and then continue to boil for another 10 minutes
2. Drain and shred potatoes
    1. Drain and rinse potatoes with cold water until easy to handle (~1 minute)
    2. Remove any bruised or brown spots with a knife
    3. Shred potatoes with box shredder or food processor (I prefer box shredder) on a cutting board
    4. Add salt and pepper to taste
3. Cook potatoes
    1. Melt butter in a large skillet or griddle over medium heat (350 degrees)
    2. Add minced garlic and let begin to brown (~1 minute)
    3. Once butter bubbles begin to settle, evenly spread potatoes over skillet
    4. Cook on one side until golden brown (or how you prefer it)
    5. Flip over and repeat on other side
