Tips:
- Stale bread. If you didn’t plan ahead, you can toast the slices in the oven. Fresh bread will get too soggy and start to disintegrate before it even gets to the pan.
- Pile up the Nutella!
- Don’t soak the bread for too long. While you want the custard to penetrate and saturate the bread, you gotta be careful not to end up with sad, soggy slices that will fall apart when frying.
- Always preheat the pan! A hot pan is the secret for that nice golden brown exterior.
- Spray the pan with cooking spray before adding the butter. That way, the butter won’t burn! You can also use a little bit of vegetable oil instead, if you prefer.

Ingredients:
- 4 slices brioche bread, about 3/4" to 1" thick
- 4 tablespoons Nutella
- 1 egg
- 1/2 cup whole milk (or half and half)
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon butter
- Powdered sugar, for dusting
- Berries, for garnishing

Instructions
1. Spread Nutella in each of the 4 pieces of bread and join them, 2 by 2, like sandwiches.
1. In a shallow bowl, whisk the egg, milk, sugar and vanilla extract until well combined.
1. Preheat a large skillet over medium heat.
1. Dip each sandwich into the custard, letting it saturate on both sides.
1. Spray pan with cooking spray and add the butter, swirling the pan to coat the bottom.
1. Once the butter is melted, add the French toasts and cook each side until golden brown (about 1-2 minutes per side).
1. Dust the Nutella French toasts with powdered sugar, top with berries and serve.
